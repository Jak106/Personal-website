        <p id="intro-text">I am a student from Slovakia. My current place of study is secondary bilingual school in Cadca Slovakia. My interests are computers, cybersecurity and web development.<br>
            <br>
            I am in fourth year of five year study. My head is full of ideas for websites and other projects. Only thing I am missing is people to do it for. That is why I created this website. I want to show what I am capable of to other people. If you are looking for someone who can make your website look professional â€“ it is me. Just check my project section to see my works. If you want to, my certificates are available for you to check as well.<br>
            <br>
            Some may think that I lack experience. It is quite understandable, but not really true. I participated in many works regarding other branches of informatics. I spent my time in python, javascript, arduino and couple of others. I created robot which was capable of navigating itself in complicated terrain. Another thing I created is a robotic arm. I created my own parts for it using Fusion 360. After that I printed them and put it all together. As I am thinking about it, this was where my informatics journey started. If you got this far I am glad, and I would be even more happy if you contacted me as well
