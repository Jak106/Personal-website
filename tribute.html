                <h2 class="tribute-title">Why does he inspire?</h2>
                <p class="tribute-text"> Dan Hampton is one of many fighter pilots who participated in combat. So what makes him special? His ability to share his experience with young guys like me and inspire them 
                    to become fighter pilots just like him. He is also able to share his experience with young fighter pilots and teach them ways of air combat as aspecially SEAD mission which
                    are on of the most dangerous missions in current warzone. Pilots flying these mission look for enemy SAM sites. This often means allow those sites to shoot and them. After
                    succesfull localization they approach and destroy those sites. All done in matter of minutes with extremely high risk of getting shot down.
                    Dan Hampton shares his experience via books he wrote such as Viper pilot. That is one my favourite books written by him. He describes his memories of air combat from early training days up to the
                    end of his carrer.
